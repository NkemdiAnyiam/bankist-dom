# Bankist DOM

This is the webpage for a fake banking company called Bankist; I created the functionality for the site during Jonas Schmedtmann's The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert! course. This project was the introduction to advanced DOM and events. Some of the  main highlights were learning how to utilize the user's scroll positions to, lazy loading images, and creating a carousel from scratch.
